Lite App 2
==========

This is the minimum sized application I could create that imported a module (lite-app didn't import a module).

## Dependencies

The module used is `lite-module` also found at `0mpurdy` on [Github](http://github.com)

It will need to be added at the same level as the lite-app-2 project or the path in `package.json` for `lite-module` will need edited.
